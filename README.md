# A Sample Portfolio

## Task

Build a Sample portfolio page, and later itncan be used to add your works.

A portfolio of work can showcase our skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. 

**Note:** If you don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, use placeholder images and names. You can change them to real applications as you create them later.

## Instructions

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Mock-Up
